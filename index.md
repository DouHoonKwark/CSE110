 I am a 4th math-cs major student.

`string major = math-cs`

*I love working out.* If I do not have anything to do, I usually go to living and start working out. I am really into growing body frame so if you are also into the same topic, we can work out together and find out better ways.

```
string favorite_items = dumbells and bar
```

Also, you can visit my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/DouHoonKwark)

Since I always code with C++, [this website](https://cplusplus.com/) is my number one favorite.

I like trying to convert complicated ideas into simple ideas as a programmer so we can share some ideas about it some time.
